agreement on file with the project.</p>

<h2 id="_code_review">Code Review</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As Gerrit is a code review tool, naturally contributions will
be reviewed before they will get submitted to the code base.  To
start your contribution, please make a git commit and upload it
for review to the main Gerrit review server.  To help speed up the
review of your change, review these guidelines before submitting
your change.  You can view the pending Gerrit contributions and
their statuses
<a href="https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/q/status:open+project:gerrit">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the size of that list it might take a while for
your change to get reviewed.  Naturally there are fewer
approvers than contributors; so anything that you can do to
ensure that your contribution will undergo fewer revisions
will speed up the contribution process.  This includes helping
out reviewing other people&#8217;s changes to relieve the load from
the approvers.  Even if you are not familiar with Gerrit&#8217;s
internals, it would be of great help if you can download, try
out, and comment on new features.  If it works as advertised,
say so, and if you have the privileges to do so, go ahead
and give it a +1 Verified.  If you would find the feature
useful, say so and give it a +1 code review.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And finally, the quicker you respond to the comments of your
reviewers, the quicker your change might get merged!  Try to
reply to every comment after submitting your new patch,
particularly if you decided against making the suggested change.
Reviewers don&#8217;t want to seem like nags and pester you if you
haven&#8217;t replied or made a fix, so it helps them know if you
missed it or decided against it.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_review_criteria">Review Criteria</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are some hints as to what approvers may be looking for
before approving or submitting changes to the Gerrit project.
Let&#8217;s start with the simple nit picky stuff.  You are likely
excited that your code works; help us share your excitement
by not distracting us with the simple stuff.  Thanks to Gerrit,
problems are often highlighted and we find it hard to look
beyond simple spacing issues.  Blame it on our short attention
spans, we really do want your code.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="commit-message">Commit Message</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is essential to have a good commit message if you want your
change to be reviewed.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keep lines no longer than 72 chars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start with a short one line summary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Followed by a blank line</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Followed by one or more explanatory paragraphs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the present tense (fix instead of fixed)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the past tense when describing the status before this commit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include a <code>Bug: Issue &lt;#&gt;</code> line if fixing a Gerrit issue, or a
<code>Feature: Issue &lt;#&gt;</code> line if implementing a feature request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include a <code>Change-Id</code> line</p>

<h3 id="_setting_up_vim_for_git_commit_message">Setting up Vim for Git commit message</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git uses Vim as the default commit message editor. Put this into your

<div class="content">
<pre>Note that the body of this commit message can be several paragraphs, and
that I word wrap it at 72 characters.  Also note that I keep the summary

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Change-Id</code> line is, as usual, created by a local git hook.  To install it,
simply copy it from the checkout and make it executable:</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are working on core plugins, you will also need to install the
same hook in the submodules:</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>export hook=$(pwd)/.git/hooks/commit-msg

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_style">Style</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic coding style is covered by the tools/GoogleFormat.xml
doc, see the <a href="dev-eclipse.html#Formatting">Eclipse Setup</a>
for that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Highlighted/additional styling notes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is generally more important to match the style of the nearby
code which you are modifying than it is to match the style
in the formatting guidelines.  This is especially true within the
same file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review your change in Gerrit to see if it highlights
mistakenly deleted/added spaces on lines, trailing spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Line length should be 80 or less, unless the code reads
better with something slightly longer.  Shorter lines not only
help reviewers who may use a tablet to review the code, but future
contributors may also like to open several editors side by
side while editing new changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use 2 spaces for indent (no tabs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use braces in all if/else/for/do/while/catch blocks, spaces before/after
if/for/while/catch parens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use /** */ style Javadocs for variables.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, you will notice that most of the newline spacing
is fairly consistent throughout the code in Gerrit, it helps to
stick to the blank line conventions.  Here are some specific
examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keep a blank line between all class and method declarations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not add blank lines at the beginning or end of class/methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put a blank line between external import sources, but not
between internal ones.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When to use <code>final</code> modifier and when not (in new code):</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Always:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>final fields: marking fields as final forces them to be
initialized in the constructor or at declaration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>final static fields: clearly communicates the intent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to use final variables in inner anonymous classes</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Optional:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>final classes: use when appropriate, e.g. API restriction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>final methods: similar to final classes</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Never:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>local variables: it clutters the code, and make the code less
readable. When copying old code to new location, finals should
be removed</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_code_organization">Code Organization</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do your best to organize classes and methods in a logical way.
Here are some guidelines that Gerrit uses:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensure a standard copyright header is included at the top
of any new files (copy it from another file, update the year).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always place loggers first in your class!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define any static interfaces next in your class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define non static interfaces after static interfaces in your
class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next you should define static types, static members, and
static methods, in decreasing order of visibility (public to private).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally instance types, instance members, then constructors,
and then instance methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some common exceptions are private helper static methods, which
might appear near the instance methods which they help (but may
also appear at the top).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getters and setters for the same instance field should usually
be near each other barring a good reason not to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using assisted injection, the factory for your class
should be before the instance members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annotations should go before language keywords (<code>final</code>, <code>private</code>, etc)<br>
Example: <code>@Assisted @Nullable final type varName</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>@Inject</code>-ed constructor arguments should be listed one per line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imports should be mostly alphabetical (uppercase sorts before
all lowercase, which means classes come before packages at the
same level).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prefer to open multiple AutoCloseable resources in the same
try-with-resources block instead of nesting the try-with-resources
blocks and increasing the indentation level more than necessary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wow that&#8217;s a lot!  But don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ll get the habit and most
of the code is organized this way already; so if you pay attention
to the class you are editing you will likely pick up on it.
Naturally new classes are a little harder; you may want to come
back and consult this section when creating them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_design">Design</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are some design level objectives that you should keep in mind
when coding:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>ORM entity objects should match exactly one row in the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most client pages should perform only one RPC to load so as to
keep latencies down.  Exceptions would apply to RPCs which need
to load large data sets if splitting them out will help the
page load faster.  Generally page loads are expected to complete
in under 100ms.  This will be the case for most operations,
unless the data being fetched is not using Gerrit&#8217;s caching
infrastructure.  In these slower cases, it is worth considering
mitigating this longer load by using a second RPC to fill in
this data after the page is displayed (or alternatively it might
be worth proposing caching this data).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>@Inject</code> should be used on constructors, not on fields.  The
current exceptions are the ssh commands, these were implemented
earlier in Gerrit&#8217;s development.  To stay consistent, new ssh
commands should follow this older pattern; but eventually these
should get converted to eliminate this exception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&#8217;t leave repository objects (git or schema) open.  A .close()
after every open should be placed in a finally{} block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&#8217;t leave UI components, which can cause new actions to occur,
enabled during RPCs which update the DB.  This is to prevent
people from submitting actions more than once when operating
on slow links.  If the action buttons are disabled, they cannot
be resubmitted and the user can see that Gerrit is still busy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GWT EventBus is the new way forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#8230;&#8203;and so is Guava (previously known as Google Collections).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_tests">Tests</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tests for new code will greatly help your change get approved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_change_size_number_of_files_touched">Change Size/Number of Files Touched</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And finally, I probably cannot say enough about change sizes.
Generally, smaller is better, hopefully within reason.  Do try to
keep things which will be confusing on their own together,
especially if changing one without the other will break something!</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a new feature is implemented and it is a larger one, try to
identify if it can be split into smaller logical features; when
in doubt, err on the smaller side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Separate bug fixes from feature improvements.  The bug fix may
be an easy candidate for approval and should not need to wait
for new features to be approved.  Also, combining the two makes
reviewing harder since then there is no clear line between the
fix and the feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Separate supporting refactoring from feature changes.  If your
new feature requires some refactoring, it helps to make the
refactoring a separate change which your feature change
depends on.  This way, reviewers can easily review the refactor
change as a something that should not alter the current
functionality, and feel more confident they can more easily
spot errors this way.  Of course, it also makes it easier to
test and locate later on if an unfortunate error does slip in.
Lastly, by not having to see refactoring changes at the same
time, it helps reviewers understand how your feature changes
the current functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Separate logical features into separate changes.  This
is often the hardest part.  Here is an example:  when adding a
new ability, make separate changes for the UI and the ssh
commands if possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do only what the commit message describes.  In other words, things which
are not strictly related to the commit message shouldn&#8217;t be part of
a change, even trivial things like externalizing a string somewhere
or fixing a typo.  This helps keep <code>git blame</code> more useful in the future
and it also makes <code>git revert</code> more useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use topics to link your separate changes together.</p>
