<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Access controls in Gerrit are group based.  Every user account is a
member of one or more groups, and access and privileges are granted
to those groups.  Access rights cannot be granted to individual
users.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="system_groups">System Groups</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gerrit comes with the following system groups:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anonymous Users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change Owner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project Owners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registered Users</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The system groups are assigned special access and membership management
privileges.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="anonymous_users">Anonymous Users</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All users are automatically a member of this group.  Users who are
not signed in are a member of only this group, and no others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any access rights assigned to this group are inherited by all users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Administrators and project owners can grant access rights to this
group in order to permit anonymous users to view project changes,
without requiring sign in first.  Currently it is only worthwhile
to grant <code>Read</code> access to this group as Gerrit requires an account
identity for all other operations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="project_owners">Project Owners</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Access rights assigned to this group are always evaluated within the
context of a project to which the access rights apply. These rights
therefore apply to all the users who are owners of this project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By assigning access rights to this group on a parent project Gerrit
administrators can define a set of default access rights for
<a href="#category_owner">project owners</a>. Child projects inherit these
access rights where they are resolved to the users that own the child
project.  Having default access rights for
<a href="#category_owner">project owners</a> assigned on a parent project may
avoid the need to initially configure access rights for
newly created child projects.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="change_owner">Change Owner</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Access rights assigned to this group are always evaluated within the
context of a change to which the access rights apply. These rights
therefore apply to the user who is the owner of this change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is typical to assign a label to this group, allowing the change
owner to vote on his change, but not actually cause it to become
approved or rejected.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="registered_users">Registered Users</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All signed-in users are automatically a member of this group (and
also <a href="#anonymous_users">'Anonymous Users'</a>, see above).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any access rights assigned to this group are inherited by all
users as soon as they sign-in to Gerrit.  If OpenID authentication
is being employed, moving from only 'Anonymous Users' into this
group is very easy.  Caution should be taken when assigning any
permissions to this group.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is typical to assign <code>Code-Review -1..+1</code> to this group,
allowing signed-in users to vote on a change, but not actually
cause it to become approved or rejected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Registered users are always permitted to make and publish comments
on any change in any project they have <code>Read</code> access to.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_predefined_groups">Predefined Groups</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Predefined groups differs from system groups by the fact that they
exist in the ACCOUNT_GROUPS table (like normal groups) but predefined groups
are created on Gerrit site initialization and unique UUIDs are assigned
to those groups. These UUIDs are different on different Gerrit sites.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gerrit comes with two predefined groups:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Administrators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-Interactive Users</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="administrators">Administrators</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a predefined group, created on Gerrit site initialization, that
has the capability <a href="access-control.html#capability_administrateServer">
'Administrate Server'</a> assigned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is a normal Gerrit group without magic. This means if you remove
the 'Administrate Server' capability from it, its members are no longer
Gerrit administrators, despite the group name. The group may also be
renamed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="non-interactive_users">Non-Interactive Users</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the Gerrit "batch" identity. The capabilities
<a href="access-control.html#capability_priority">'Priority BATCH'</a> and
<a href="access-control.html#capability_streamEvents">'Stream Events'</a>
are assigned to this predefined group on Gerrit site creation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The members of this group are not expected to perform interactive
operations on the Gerrit web front-end.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, sometimes such a user may need a separate thread pool in
order to prevent it from grabbing threads from the interactive users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These users live in a second thread pool, which separates operations
made by the non-interactive users from the ones made by the interactive
users. This ensures that the interactive users can keep working when
resources are tight.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_account_groups">Account Groups</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Account groups contain a list of zero or more user account members,
added individually by a group owner.  Any user account listed as
a group member is given any access rights granted to the group.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every group has one other group designated as its owner.  Users who
are members of the owner group can:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add users and other groups to this group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove users and other groups from this group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the name of this group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the description of this group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the owner of this group, to another group</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is permissible for a group to own itself, allowing the group
members to directly manage who their peers are.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Newly created groups are automatically created as owning themselves,
with the creating user as the only member.  This permits the group
creator to add additional members, and change the owner to another
group if desired.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is somewhat common to create two groups at the same time,
for example <code>Foo</code> and <code>Foo-admin</code>, where the latter group
<code>Foo-admin</code> owns both itself and also group <code>Foo</code>.  Users who
are members of <code>Foo-admin</code> can thus control the membership of
<code>Foo</code>, without actually having the access rights granted to <code>Foo</code>.
This configuration can help prevent accidental submits when the
members of <code>Foo</code> have submit rights on a project, and the members of
<code>Foo-admin</code> typically do not need to have such rights.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="ldap_groups">LDAP Groups</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>LDAP groups are Account Groups that are maintained inside of your
LDAP instance. If you are using LDAP to manage your groups they will
not appear in the Groups list. However you can use them just like
regular Account Groups by prefixing your group with "ldap/" in the
Access Control for a project. For example "ldap/foo-project" will
add the LDAP "foo-project" group to the access list.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_project_access_control_lists">Project Access Control Lists</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A system wide access control list affecting all projects is stored in
project &#8220;All-Projects&#8221;.  This inheritance can be configured
through <a href="cmd-set-project-parent.html">gerrit set-project-parent</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Per-project access control lists are also supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users are permitted to use the maximum range granted to any of their
groups on a label.  For example, a user is a member of <code>Foo Leads</code>, and
the following ACLs are granted on a project:</p>
</div>
<table class="tableblock frame-all grid-all spread">

<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">-2..0</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then the effective range permitted to be used by the user is
<code>-2..+2</code>, as the user is a member of all three groups (see above
about the system groups) and the maximum range is chosen (so the
lowest value granted to any group, and the highest value granted
to any group).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reference-level access control is also possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Permissions can be set on a single reference name to match one
branch (e.g. <code>refs/heads/master</code>), or on a reference namespace
(e.g. <code>refs/heads/*</code>) to match any branch starting with that
prefix. So a permission with <code>refs/heads/*</code> will match all of
<code>refs/heads/master</code>, <code>refs/heads/experimental</code>, <code>refs/heads/release/1.0</code> etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reference names can also be described with a regular expression
by prefixing the reference name with <code>^</code>.  For example
<code>^refs/heads/[a-z]{1,8}</code> matches all lower case branch names
between 1 and 8 characters long.  Within a regular expression <code>.</code>
is a wildcard matching any character, but may be escaped as <code>\.</code>.
The <a href="http://www.brics.dk/automaton/">dk.brics.automaton library</a>
is used for evaluation of regular expression access control
rules. See the library documentation for details on this
particular regular expression flavor. One quirk is that the
shortest possible pattern expansion must be a valid ref name:
thus <code>^refs/heads/.*/name</code> will fail because <code>refs/heads//name</code>
is not a valid reference, but <code>^refs/heads/.+/name</code> will work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>References can have the user name or the sharded account ID of the
current user automatically included, creating dynamic access controls
that change to match the currently logged in user.  For example to
provide a personal sandbox space to all developers,
<code>refs/heads/sandbox/${username}/*</code> allows the user 'joe' to use
'refs/heads/sandbox/joe/foo'. The sharded account ID can be used to
give users access to their user branch in the <code>All-Users</code> repository,
for example <code>refs/users/${shardeduserid}</code> is resolved to
'refs/users/23/1011123' if the account ID of the current user is
<code>1011123</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When evaluating a reference-level access right, Gerrit will use
the full set of access rights to determine if the user
is allowed to perform a given action. For example, if a user is a
member of <code>Foo Leads</code>, they are reviewing a change destined for
the <code>refs/heads/qa</code> branch, and the following ACLs are granted
on the project:</p>

to more groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ownership of this project cannot be delegated to another group.
This restriction is by design.  Granting ownership to another

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, every reference under refs/* is really available, and in Gerrit this
opportunity for giving other refs a special meaning is used.  In Gerrit they
are sometimes used as magic/virtual references that give the push to Gerrit a
special meaning.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="references_special">Special references</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The special references have content that&#8217;s either generated by Gerrit or
contains important project configuration that Gerrit needs. When making
changes to these references, Gerrit will take extra precautions to verify the
contents compatibility at upload time.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_refs_changes">refs/changes/*</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Under this namespace each uploaded patch set for every change gets a static
reference in their git.  The format is convenient but still intended to scale to
hundreds of thousands of patch sets.  To access a given patch set you will
need the change number and patch set number.</p>

<h2 id="access_categories">Access Categories</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gerrit has several permission categories that can be granted to groups
within projects, enabling functionality for that group&#8217;s members.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="category_abandon">Abandon</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This category controls whether users are allowed to abandon changes
to projects in Gerrit. It can give permission to abandon a specific
change to a given ref.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The uploader of a change, anyone granted the <a href="#category_owner"><code>Owner</code></a>
permission at the ref or project level, and anyone granted the
<a href="#capability_administrateServer"><code>Administrate Server</code></a>
permission can also Abandon changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This also grants the permission to restore a change if the user also
has <a href="#category_push">push permission</a> on the change&#8217;s destination
ref.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="category_create">Create Reference</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The create reference category controls whether it is possible to
create new references, branches or tags.  This implies that the
reference must not already exist, it&#8217;s not a destructive permission
in that you can&#8217;t overwrite or remove any previously existing
references (and also discard any commits in the process).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s probably most common to either permit the creation of a single
branch in many gits (by granting permission on a parent project), or
to grant this permission to a name pattern of branches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This permission is often given in conjunction with regular push
branch permissions, allowing the holder of both to create new branches
as well as bypass review for new commits on that branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To push lightweight (non-annotated) tags, grant
<code>Create Reference</code> for reference name <code>refs/tags/*</code>, as lightweight
tags are implemented just like branches in Git. To push a lightweight
tag on a new commit (commit not reachable from any branch/tag) grant
<code>Push</code> permission on <code>refs/tags/*</code> too. The <code>Push</code> permission on
<code>refs/tags/*</code> also allows fast-forwarding of lightweight tags.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, to grant the possibility to create new branches under the
namespace <code>foo</code>, you have to grant this permission on
<code>refs/heads/foo/*</code> for the group that should have it.
Finally, if you plan to grant each user a personal namespace in
where they are free to create as many branches as they wish, you
should grant the create reference permission so it&#8217;s possible
to create new branches. This is done by using the special
<code>${username}</code> keyword in the reference pattern, e.g.
<code>refs/heads/sandbox/${username}/*</code>. If you do, it&#8217;s also recommended
you grant the users the push force permission to be able to clean up
stale branches.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="category_delete">Delete Reference</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The delete reference category controls whether it is possible to delete
references, branches or tags. It doesn&#8217;t allow any other update of
references.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deletion of references is also possible if <code>Push</code> with the force option
is granted, however that includes the permission to fast-forward and
force-update references to exiting and new commits. Being able to push
references for new commits is bad if bypassing of code review must be
prevented.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="category_forge_author">Forge Author</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normally Gerrit requires the author and the committer identity
lines in a Git commit object (or tagger line in an annotated tag) to
match one of the registered email addresses of the uploading user.
This permission allows users to bypass parts of that validation, which
may be necessary when mirroring changes from an upstream project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Permits the use of an unverified author line in commit objects.
This can be useful when applying patches received by email from
3rd parties, when cherry-picking changes written by others across
branches, or when amending someone else&#8217;s commit to fix up a minor
problem before submitting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default this is granted to <code>Registered Users</code> in all projects,
but a site administrator may disable it if verified authorship
is required.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="category_forge_committer">Forge Committer</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normally Gerrit requires the author and the committer identity
lines in a Git commit object (or tagger line in an annotated tag) to
match one of the registered email addresses of the uploading user.
This permission allows users to bypass parts of that validation, which
may be necessary when mirroring changes from an upstream project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allows the use of an unverified committer line in commit objects, or an
unverified tagger line in annotated tag objects.  Typically this is only
required when mirroring commits from an upstream project repository.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="category_forge_server">Forge Server</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normally Gerrit requires the author and the committer identity
lines in a Git commit object (or tagger line in an annotated tag) to
match one of the registered email addresses of the uploading user.
This permission allows users to bypass parts of that validation, which
may be necessary when mirroring changes from an upstream project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allows the use of the server&#8217;s own name and email on the committer
line of a new commit object.  This should only be necessary when force
pushing a commit history which has been rewritten by 'git filter-branch'
and that contains merge commits previously created by this Gerrit Code
Review server.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="category_owner">Owner</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Owner</code> category controls which groups can modify the project&#8217;s
configuration.  Users who are members of an owner group can:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Change the project description</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a branch via the ssh command <a href="cmd-create-branch.html">'create-branch'</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create/delete a branch through the web UI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grant/revoke any access rights, including <code>Owner</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get SSH branch access project owners must grant an access right to a group
they are a member of, just like for any other user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ownership over a particular branch subspace may be delegated by
entering a branch pattern.  To delegate control over all branches
that begin with <code>qa/</code> to the QA group, add <code>Owner</code> category
for reference <code>refs/heads/qa/*</code>.  Members of the QA group can
further refine access, but only for references that begin with
<code>refs/heads/qa/</code>. See <a href="#project_owners">project owners</a> to find
out more about this role.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the <code>All-Projects</code> root project any <code>Owner</code> access right on
'refs/*' is ignored since this permission would allow users to edit the
global capabilities, which is the same as being able to administrate
the Gerrit server (e.g. the user could assign the <code>Administrate Server</code>
capability to the own account).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="category_push">Push</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This category controls how users are allowed to upload new commits
to projects in Gerrit. It can either give permission to push
directly into a branch, bypassing any code review process
that would otherwise be used. Or it may give permission to upload
new changes for code review, this depends on which namespace the
permission is granted to.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="category_push_direct">Direct Push</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any existing branch can be fast-forwarded to a new commit.
Creation of new branches is controlled by the
<a href="access-control.html#category_create">'Create Reference'</a>
category.  Deletion of existing branches is rejected.  This is the
safest mode as commits cannot be discarded.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Force option</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allows an existing branch to be deleted. Since a force push is
effectively a delete immediately followed by a create, but performed
atomically on the server and logged, this option also permits forced
push updates to branches.  Enabling this option allows existing commits
to be discarded from a project history.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The push category is primarily useful for projects that only want to
take advantage of Gerrit&#8217;s access control features and do not need
its code review functionality.  Projects that need to require code
reviews should not grant this category.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="category_push_review">Upload To Code Review</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Push</code> access right granted on the namespace
<code>refs/for/refs/heads/BRANCH</code> permits the user to upload a non-merge
commit to the project&#8217;s <code>refs/for/BRANCH</code> namespace, creating a new
change for code review.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A user must be able to clone or fetch the project in order to create
a new commit on their local system, so in practice they must also
have the <code>Read</code> access granted to upload a change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For an open source, public Gerrit installation, it is common to grant
<code>Push</code> for <code>refs/for/refs/heads/*</code> to <code>Registered Users</code> in the
<code>All-Projects</code> ACL.  For more private installations, its common to
grant <code>Push</code> for <code>refs/for/refs/heads/*</code> to all users of a project.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Force option</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The force option has no function when granted to a branch in the
<code>refs/for/refs/heads/*</code> namespace.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="category_add_patch_set">Add Patch Set</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This category controls which users are allowed to upload new patch sets to
existing changes. Irrespective of this permission, change owners are always
allowed to upload new patch sets for their changes. This permission needs to be
set on <code>refs/for/*</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, this permission is granted to <code>Registered Users</code> on <code>refs/for/*</code>,
allowing all registered users to upload a new patch set to any change. Revoking
this permission (by granting it to no groups and setting the "Exclusive" flag)
will prevent users from uploading a patch set to a change they do not own.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="category_push_merge">Push Merge Commits</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Push Merge Commit</code> access right permits the user to upload merge
commits.  It&#8217;s an add-on to the <a href="#category_push">Push</a> access right, and
so it won&#8217;t be sufficient with only <code>Push Merge Commit</code> granted for a
push to happen.  Some projects wish to restrict merges to being created
by Gerrit. By granting <code>Push</code> without <code>Push Merge Commit</code>, the only
merges that enter the system will be those created by Gerrit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reference name connected to a <code>Push Merge Commit</code> entry must always
be prefixed with <code>refs/for/</code>, for example <code>refs/for/refs/heads/BRANCH</code>.
This applies even for an entry that complements a <code>Push</code> entry for
<code>refs/heads/BRANCH</code> that allows direct pushes of non-merge commits, and
the intention of the <code>Push Merge Commit</code> entry is to allow direct pushes
of merge commits.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="category_create_annotated">Create Annotated Tag</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This category permits users to push an annotated tag object into the
project&#8217;s repository.  Typically this would be done with a command line
such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>  git push ssh://USER@HOST:PORT/PROJECT tag v1.0</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Or:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>  git push https://HOST/PROJECT tag v1.0</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tags must be annotated (created with <code>git tag -a</code>), should exist in
the <code>refs/tags/</code> namespace, and should be new.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This category is intended to be used to publish tags when a project
reaches a stable release point worth remembering in history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It allows for a new annotated (unsigned) tag to be created.  The
tagger email address must be verified for the current user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To push tags created by users other than the current user (such
as tags mirrored from an upstream project), <code>Forge Committer Identity</code>
must be also granted in addition to <code>Create Annotated Tag</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To push lightweight (non annotated) tags, grant
<a href="#category_create"><code>Create Reference</code></a> for reference name
<code>refs/tags/*</code>, as lightweight tags are implemented just like
branches in Git.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To delete or overwrite an existing tag, grant <code>Push</code> with the force
option enabled for reference name <code>refs/tags/*</code>, as deleting a tag
requires the same permission as deleting a branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To push an annotated tag on a new commit (commit not reachable from any
branch/tag) grant <code>Push</code> permission on <code>refs/tags/*</code> too.
The <code>Push</code> permission on <code>refs/tags/*</code> does <strong>not</strong> allow updating of annotated
tags, not even fast-forwarding of annotated tags. Update of annotated tags
is only allowed by granting <code>Push</code> with <code>force</code> option on <code>refs/tags/*</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="category_create_signed">Create Signed Tag</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This category permits users to push a PGP signed tag object into the
project&#8217;s repository.  Typically this would be done with a command
line such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>  git push ssh://USER@HOST:PORT/PROJECT tag v1.0</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>  git push https://HOST/PROJECT tag v1.0</pre>

<p>Tags must be signed (created with <code>git tag -s</code>), should exist in the
<code>refs/tags/</code> namespace, and should be new.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="category_read">Read</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Read</code> category controls visibility to the project&#8217;s
changes, comments, code diffs, and Git access over SSH or HTTP.
A user must have this access granted in order to see a project, its
changes, or any of its data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This category has a special behavior, where the per-project ACL is
evaluated before the global all projects ACL.  If the per-project
ACL has granted <code>Read</code> with 'DENY', and does not otherwise grant
<code>Read</code> with 'ALLOW', then a <code>Read</code> in the all projects ACL
is ignored.  This behavior is useful to hide a handful of projects
on an otherwise public server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For an open source, public Gerrit installation it is common to grant
<code>Read</code> to <code>Anonymous Users</code> in the <code>All-Projects</code> ACL, enabling
casual browsing of any project&#8217;s changes, as well as fetching any
project&#8217;s repository over SSH or HTTP.  New projects can be
temporarily hidden from public view by granting <code>Read</code> with 'DENY'
to <code>Anonymous Users</code> and granting <code>Read</code> to the project owner&#8217;s
group within the per-project ACL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a private Gerrit installation using a trusted HTTP authentication
source, granting <code>Read</code> to <code>Registered Users</code> may be more
typical, enabling read access only to those users who have been
able to authenticate through the HTTP access controls.  This may
be suitable in a corporate deployment if the HTTP access control
is already restricted to the correct set of users.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="category_rebase">Rebase</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This category permits users to rebase changes via the web UI by pushing
the <code>Rebase Change</code> button.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The change owner and submitters can always rebase changes in the web UI
(even without having the <code>Rebase</code> access right assigned).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users without this access right who are able to upload new patch sets
can still do the rebase locally and upload the rebased commit as a new
patch set.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="category_remove_reviewer">Remove Reviewer</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This category permits users to remove other users from the list of
reviewers on a change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Change owners can always remove reviewers who have given a zero or positive
score (even without having the <code>Remove Reviewer</code> access right assigned).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project owners and site administrators can always remove any reviewer (even
without having the <code>Remove Reviewer</code> access right assigned).</p>

<h3 id="category_review_labels">Review Labels</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For every configured label <code>My-Name</code> in the project, there is a

the defined values. There is also a corresponding <code>labelAs-My-Name</code>
permission that enables editing another user&#8217;s label.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gerrit comes pre-configured with a default 'Code-Review' label that can

<h3 id="examples_cisystem">CI system</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A typical Continuous Integration system should be able to download new changes
to build and then leave a verdict somehow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an example, the popular
<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Trigger">gerrit-trigger plugin</a>
for Jenkins/Hudson can set labels at:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The start of a build</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A successful build</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An unstable build (tests fails)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A failed build</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually the range chosen for this verdict is the <code>Verified</code> label.  Depending on
the size of your project and discipline of involved developers you might want
to limit access right to the +1 <code>Verified</code> label to the CI system only.  That
way it&#8217;s guaranteed that submitted commits always get built and pass tests
successfully.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the build doesn&#8217;t complete successfully the CI system can set the
<code>Verified</code> label to -1.  However that means that a failed build will block
submit of the change even if someone else sets <code>Verified</code> +1.  Depending on the
project and how much the CI system can be trusted for accurate results, a
blocking label might not be feasible.  A recommended alternative is to set the
label <code>Code-review</code> to -1 instead, as it isn&#8217;t a blocking label but still
shows a red label in the Gerrit UI.  Optionally, to enable the possibility to
deliver different results (build error vs unstable for instance), it&#8217;s also
possible to set <code>Code-review</code> +1 as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If pushing new changes is granted, it&#8217;s possible to automate cherry-pick of
submitted changes for upload to other branches under certain conditions.  This
is probably not the first step of what a project wants to automate however,
and so the push right can be found under the optional section.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By granting the <a href="#category_owner"><code>Owner</code></a> access right on the <code>refs/*</code> to a
group, Gerrit administrators can delegate the responsibility of maintaining
access rights for that project to that group.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a corporate deployment it is often necessary to enforce some access
policies. An example could be that no-one can update or delete a tag, not even
the project owners. The 'ALLOW' and 'DENY' rules are not enough for this
purpose as project owners can grant themselves any access right they wish and,
thus, effectively override any inherited access rights from the
&#8220;All-Projects&#8221; or some other common parent project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is needed is a mechanism to block a permission in a parent project so
that even project owners cannot allow a blocked permission in their child
project. Still, project owners should retain the possibility to manage all
non-blocked rules as they wish. This gives best of both worlds:</p>
</div>

<h3 id="block">'BLOCK' access rule</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 'BLOCK' rule blocks a permission globally. An inherited 'BLOCK'
rule cannot be overridden in the inheriting project. Any 'ALLOW' rule
from an inheriting project, which conflicts with an inherited 'BLOCK'
rule will not be honored. Searching for 'BLOCK' rules, in the chain
of parent projects, ignores the Exclusive flag, unless the rule with
the Exclusive flag is defined on the same project as the 'BLOCK'
rule. This means within the same project a 'BLOCK' rule can be
overruled by 'ALLOW' rules on the same access section and 'ALLOW'
rules with Exclusive flag on access section for more specific refs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A 'BLOCK' rule that blocks the 'push' permission blocks any type of push,
force or not. A blocking force push rule blocks only force pushes, but
allows non-forced pushes if an 'ALLOW' rule would have permitted it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also possible to block label ranges.  To block a group 'X' from voting
'-2' and '+2', but keep their existing voting permissions for the '-1..+1'
range intact we would define:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>  [access "refs/heads/*"]
    label-Code-Review = block -2..+2 group X</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The interpretation of the 'min..max' range in case of a blocking rule is: block
every vote from '-INFINITE..min' and 'max..INFINITE'. For the example above it
means that the range '-1..+1' is not affected by this block.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="__block_and_allow_rules_in_the_same_access_section">'BLOCK' and 'ALLOW' rules in the same access section</h3>

<pre>  [access "refs/heads/*"]
    push = block group X

a replication task or a user initiated task such as an upload-pack or
receive-pack.</p>

<h3 id="capability_maintainServer">Maintain Server</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allow basic, constrained server maintenance tasks, such as flushing caches and

<h3 id="capability_modifyAccount">Modify Account</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allow to <a href="cmd-set-account.html">modify accounts over the ssh prompt</a>.
This capability allows the granted group members to modify any user account
setting.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="capability_priority">Priority</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This capability allows users to use
<a href="config-gerrit.html#sshd.batchThreads">the thread pool reserved</a> for
<a href="access-control.html#non-interactive_users">'Non-Interactive Users'</a>.
It&#8217;s a binary value in that granted users either have access to the thread
pool, or they don&#8217;t.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are three modes for this capability and they&#8217;re listed by rising
priority:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">No capability configured.</dt>
<dd>
<p>The user isn&#8217;t a member of a group with any priority capability granted. By
default the user is then in the 'INTERACTIVE' thread pool.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">'BATCH'</dt>
<dd>
<p>If there&#8217;s a thread pool configured for 'Non-Interactive Users' and a user is
granted the priority capability with the 'BATCH' mode selected, the user ends
up in the separate batch user thread pool. This is true unless the user is
also granted the below 'INTERACTIVE' option.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">'INTERACTIVE'</dt>
<dd>
<p>If a user is granted the priority capability with the 'INTERACTIVE' option,
regardless if they also have the 'BATCH' option or not, they are in the
'INTERACTIVE' thread pool.</p>
</dd>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="capability_queryLimit">Query Limit</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allow site administrators to configure the query limit for users to
be above the default hard-coded value of 500.  Administrators can add
a global block to <code>All-Projects</code> with group(s) that should have different
limits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When applying a query limit to a user the largest value granted by
any of their groups is used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This limit applies not only to the <a href="cmd-query.html"><code>gerrit query</code></a>
command, but also to the web UI results pagination size.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="capability_runAs">Run As</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allow users to impersonate any other user with the <code>X-Gerrit-RunAs</code>
HTTP header on REST API calls, or the <a href="cmd-suexec.html">suexec</a>
SSH command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When impersonating an administrator the Administrate Server capability
is not honored.  This security feature tries to prevent a role with
Run As capability from modifying the access controls in All-Projects,
however modification may still be possible if the impersonated user
has permission to push or submit changes on <code>refs/meta/config</code>.  Run
As also blocks using most capabilities including Create User, Run
Garbage Collection, etc., unless the capability is also explicitly
granted to a group the administrator is a member of.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Administrators do not automatically inherit this capability; it must
be explicitly granted.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="capability_runGC">Run Garbage Collection</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allow users to run the Git garbage collection for the repositories of
all projects.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="capability_streamEvents">Stream Events</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allow performing streaming of Gerrit events. This capability

<h3 id="capability_viewCaches">View Caches</h3>
