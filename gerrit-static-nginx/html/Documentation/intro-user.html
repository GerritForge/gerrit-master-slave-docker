<h2 id="gerrit">What is Gerrit?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gerrit is a Git server that provides <a href="access-control.html">access
control</a> for the hosted Git repositories and a web front-end for doing
<a href="#code-review">code review</a>. Code review is a core functionality of
Gerrit, but still it is optional and teams can decide to
<a href="#no-code-review">work without code review</a>.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gerrit speaks the git protocol. This means in order to work with Gerrit
you do <strong>not</strong> need to install any Gerrit client, but having a regular
git client, such as the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git command line</a> or
<a href="http://eclipse.org/egit/">EGit</a> in Eclipse, is sufficient.</p>

<h2 id="code-review">Code Review Workflow</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With Gerrit <em>Code Review</em> means to <a href="#review-change">review</a> every
commit <strong>before</strong> it is accepted into the code base. The author of a code
modification <a href="user-upload.html#push_create">uploads a commit</a> as a
change to Gerrit. In Gerrit each change is stored in a
<a href="#change-ref">staging area</a> where it can be checked and reviewed.
Only when it is approved and submitted it gets applied to the code
base. If there is feedback on a change, the author can improve the code
modification by <a href="#upload-patch-set">amending the commit and
uploading the new commit as a new patch set</a>. This way a change is
improved iteratively and it is applied to the code base only when is
ready.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="upload-change">Upload a Change</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Uploading a change to Gerrit is done by pushing a commit to Gerrit. The
commit must be pushed to a ref in the <code>refs/for/</code> namespace which
defines the target branch: <code>refs/for/&lt;target-branch&gt;</code>.
The magic <code>refs/for/</code> prefix allows Gerrit to differentiate commits
that are pushed for review from commits that are pushed directly into
the repository, bypassing code review. For the target branch it is
sufficient to specify the short name, e.g. <code>master</code>, but you can also
specify the fully qualified branch name, e.g. <code>refs/heads/master</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Push for Code Review</div>

</div>
<div id="change-ref" class="paragraph">
<p>When a commit is pushed for review, Gerrit stores it in a staging area
which is a branch in the special <code>refs/changes/</code> namespace. A change
ref has the format <code>refs/changes/XX/YYYY/ZZ</code> where <code>YYYY</code> is the
numeric change number, <code>ZZ</code> is the patch set number and <code>XX</code> is the
last two digits of the numeric change number, e.g.
<code>refs/changes/20/884120/1</code>. Understanding the format of this ref is not
required for working with Gerrit.</p>
</div>
<div id="fetch-change" class="paragraph">
<p>Using the change ref git clients can fetch the corresponding commit,
e.g. for local verification.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>refs/for/</code> prefix is used to map the Gerrit concept of
"Pushing for Review" to the git protocol. For the git client it looks
like every push goes to the same branch, e.g. <code>refs/for/master</code> but in
fact for each commit that is pushed to this ref Gerrit creates a new
branch under the <code>refs/changes/</code> namespace. In addition Gerrit creates
an open change.</p>
</div>
<div id="change" class="paragraph">
<p>A change consists of a <a href="user-changeid.html">Change-Id</a>, meta data
(owner, project, target branch etc.), one or more patch sets, comments
and votes. A patch set is a git commit. Each patch set in a change
represents a new version of the change and replaces the previous patch
set. Only the latest patch set is relevant. This means all failed
iterations of a change will never be applied to the target branch, but
only the last patch set that is approved is integrated.</p>
</div>
<div id="change-id" class="paragraph">
<p>The Change-Id is important for Gerrit to know whether a commit that is
pushed for code review should create a new change or whether it should
create a new patch set for an existing change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Change-Id is a SHA-1 that is prefixed with an uppercase <code>I</code>. It is
specified as footer in the commit message (last paragraph):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>  Improve foo widget by attaching a bar.

  We want a bar, because it improves the foo by providing more
  wizbangery to the dowhatimeanery.

  Bug: #42
  Change-Id: Ic8aaa0728a43936cd4c6e1ed590e01ba8f0fbf5b
  Signed-off-by: A. U. Thor &lt;author@example.com&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a commit that has a Change-Id in its commit message is pushed for
review, Gerrit checks if a change with this Change-Id already exists
for this project and target branch, and if yes, Gerrit creates a new
patch set for this change. If not, a new change with the given
Change-Id is created.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a commit without Change-Id is pushed for review, Gerrit creates a
new change and generates a Change-Id for it. Since in this case the
Change-Id is not included in the commit message, it must be manually
inserted when a new patch set should be uploaded. Most projects already
<a href="project-configuration.html#require-change-id">require a Change-Id</a>
when pushing the very first patch set. This reduces the risk of
accidentally creating a new change instead of uploading a new patch
set. Any push without Change-Id then fails with
<a href="error-missing-changeid.html">missing Change-Id in commit message
footer</a>. New patch sets can always be uploaded to a specific change
(even without any Change-Id) by pushing to the change ref, e.g.
<code>refs/changes/74/67374</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Amending and rebasing a commit preserves the Change-Id so that the new
commit automatically becomes a new patch set of the existing change,
when it is pushed for review.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Push new Patch Set</div>
<div class="content">
<pre>  $ git commit --amend
  $ git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Change-Ids are unique for a branch of a project. E.g. commits that fix
the same issue in different branches should have the same Change-Id,
which happens automatically if a commit is cherry-picked to another
branch. This way you can <a href="user-search.html">search</a> by the Change-Id
in the Gerrit web UI to find a fix in all branches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Change-Ids can be created automatically by installing the <code>commit-msg</code>
hook as described in the <a href="user-changeid.html#creation">Change-Id
documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of manually installing the <code>commit-msg</code> hook for each git
repository, you can copy it into the
<a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-init#_template_directory">git template
directory</a>. Then it is automatically copied to every newly cloned
repository.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">

<p>It is important that the commit message contains the

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Code review takes time, which can be used by the change author to
implement other features. Each feature should be implemented in its own
local feature branch that is based on the current HEAD of the target
branch. This way there is no dependency to open changes and new
features can be reviewed and applied independently. If wanted, it is
also possible to base a new feature on an open change. This will create
a dependency between the changes in Gerrit and each change can only be
applied if all its predecessor are applied as well. Dependencies
between changes can be seen from the

<h2 id="watch">Watching Projects</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get to know about new changes you can <a href="user-notify.html#user">
watch the projects</a> that you are interested in. For watched projects
Gerrit sends you email notifications when a change is uploaded or
modified. You can decide on which events you want to be notified and
you can filter the notifications by using <a href="user-search.html">change
search expressions</a>. For example 'branch:master file:^.*\.txt$' would
send you email notifications only for changes in the master branch that
touch a 'txt' file.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the <a href="user-review-ui.html#reviewers">change screen</a> reviewers can
be added explicitly to a change. The added reviewer will then be
notified by email about the review request.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mainly this functionality is used to request the review of specific
person who is known to be an expert in the modified code or who is a
stakeholder of the implemented feature. Normally it is not needed to
explicitly add reviewers on every change, but you rather rely on the
project team to watch their project and to process the incoming changes
by importance, interest, time etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are also <a href="intro-project-owner.html#reviewers">plugins which
can add reviewers automatically</a> (e.g. by configuration or based on git
blame annotations). If this functionality is required it should be

<h2 id="dashboards">Dashboards</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gerrit supports a wide range of <a href="user-search.html#search-operators">
query operators</a> to search for changes by different criteria, e.g. by
status, change owner, votes etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The page that shows the results of a change query has the change query
contained in its URL. This means you can bookmark this URL in your
browser to save the change query. This way it can be easily re-executed
later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several change queries can be also combined into a dashboard. A
dashboard is a screen in Gerrit that presents the results of several
change queries in different sections, each section having a descriptive
title.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A default dashboard is available under <code>My</code> &gt; <code>Changes</code>. It has
sections to list outgoing reviews, incoming reviews and recently closed
changes.</p>
