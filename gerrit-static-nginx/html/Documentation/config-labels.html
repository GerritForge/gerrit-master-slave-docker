<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of the code review process, reviewers score each change with
values for each label configured for the project.  The label values that
a given user is allowed to set are defined according to the
<a href="access-control.html#category_review_labels">access controls</a>.  Gerrit
comes pre-configured with the Code-Review label that can be granted to
groups within projects, enabling functionality for that group&#8217;s members.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="label_Code-Review">Label: Code-Review</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code review label is the second of two default labels that is
configured upon the creation of a Gerrit instance.  It may have any
meaning the project desires.  It was originally invented by the Android
Open Source Project to mean 'I read the code and it seems reasonably
correct'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The range of values is:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>-2 This shall not be merged</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code is so horribly incorrect/buggy/broken that it must not be
submitted to this project, or to this branch.  This value is valid
across all patch sets in the same change, i.e. the reviewer must
actively change his/her review to something else before the change
is submittable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Any -2 blocks submit.</strong></p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>-1 I would prefer this is not merged as is</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code doesn&#8217;t look right, or could be done differently, but
the reviewer is willing to live with it as-is if another reviewer
accepts it, perhaps because it is better than what is currently in
the project.  Often this is also used by contributors who don&#8217;t like
the change, but also aren&#8217;t responsible for the project long-term
and thus don&#8217;t have final say on change submission.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Does not block submit.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>0 No score</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Didn&#8217;t try to perform the code review task, or glanced over it but
don&#8217;t have an informed opinion yet.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>+1 Looks good to me, but someone else must approve</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code looks right to this reviewer, but the reviewer doesn&#8217;t
have access to the <code>+2</code> value for this category.  Often this is
used by contributors to a project who were able to review the change
and like what it is doing, but don&#8217;t have final approval over what
gets submitted.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>+2 Looks good to me, approved</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Basically the same as <code>+1</code>, but for those who have final say over
how the project will develop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Any +2 enables submit.</strong></p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a change to be submittable, the latest patch set must have a
<code>+2 Looks good to me, approved</code> in this category, and no
<code>-2 Do not submit</code>.  Thus <code>-2</code> on any patch set can block a submit,
while <code>+2</code> on the latest patch set can enable it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a Gerrit installation does not wish to use this label in any project,
the <code>[label "Code-Review"]</code> section can be deleted from <code>project.config</code>
in <code>All-Projects</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a Gerrit installation or project wants to modify the description text
associated with these label values, the text can be updated in the
<code>label.Code-Review.value</code> fields in <code>project.config</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additional entries could be added to <code>label.Code-Review.value</code> to
further extend the negative and positive range, but there is likely
little value in doing so as this only expands the middle region.  This
label is a <code>MaxWithBlock</code> type, which means that the lowest negative
value if present blocks a submit, while the highest positive value is
required to enable submit.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="label_Verified">Label: Verified</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Verified label was originally invented by the Android Open Source
Project to mean 'compiles, passes basic unit tests'.  Some CI tools
expect to use the Verified label to vote on a change after running.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Administrators can install the Verified label by adding the following
text to <code>project.config</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>  [label "Verified"]
      function = MaxWithBlock
      value = -1 Fails
      value =  0 No score
      value = +1 Verified</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The range of values is:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>-1 Fails</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tried to compile, but got a compile error, or tried to run tests,
but one or more tests did not pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Any -1 blocks submit.</strong></p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>0 No score</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Didn&#8217;t try to perform the verification tasks.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>+1 Verified</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compiled (and ran tests) successfully.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Any +1 enables submit.</strong></p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a change to be submittable, the change must have a <code>+1 Verified</code>
in this label, and no <code>-1 Fails</code>.  Thus, <code>-1 Fails</code> can block a submit,
while <code>+1 Verified</code> enables a submit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additional values could also be added to this label, to allow it to
behave more like <code>Code-Review</code> (below).  Add -2 and +2 entries to the
<code>label.Verified.value</code> fields in <code>project.config</code> to get the same
behavior.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="label_custom">Your Label Here</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Site administrators and project owners can also define their own labels.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See above for descriptions of how <a href="#label_Verified"><code>Verified</code></a>
and <a href="#label_Code-Review"><code>Code-Review</code></a> work, and add your own
label to <code>project.config</code> to get the same behavior over your own range
of values, for any label you desire.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just like the built-in labels, users need to be given permissions to
vote on custom labels. Permissions can either be added by manually
editing project.config when adding the labels, or, once the labels are
added, permission categories for those labels will show up in the
permission editor web UI.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Labels may be added to any project&#8217;s <code>project.config</code>; the default
labels are defined in <code>All-Projects</code>. Labels are inherited from parent
projects; a child project may add, override, or remove labels defined in
its parents.  Overriding a label in a child project overrides all its
properties and values.  To remove a label in a child project, add an
empty label with the same name as in the parent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Labels are laid out in the order they are specified in project.config,
with inherited labels appearing first, providing some layout control to
the administrator.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="label_name"><code>label.Label-Name</code></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The name for a label, consisting only of alphanumeric characters and
<code>-</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="label_value"><code>label.Label-Name.value</code></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A multi-valued key whose values are of the form <code>"&lt;#&gt; Value description
text"</code>. The <code>&lt;#&gt;</code> may be any positive or negative number with an
optional leading <code>+</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="label_defaultValue"><code>label.Label-Name.defaultValue</code></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default value (or score) for the label.  The defaultValue must be
within the range of valid label values.  It is an optional label setting,
if not defined the defaultValue for the label will be 0.  When a
defaultValue is defined, that value will get set in the Reply dialog
by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A defaultValue can be set to a score that is outside of the permissible
range for a user.  In that case the score that will get set in the Reply
box will be either the lowest or highest score in the permissible range.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="label_function"><code>label.Label-Name.function</code></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The name of a function for evaluating multiple votes for a label.  This
function is only applied if the default submit rule is used for a label.
If you write a <a href="prolog-cookbook.html#HowToWriteSubmitRules">custom
submit rule</a> (and do not call the default rule), the function name is
ignored and may be treated as optional.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Valid values are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>MaxWithBlock</code> (default)</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lowest possible negative value, if present, blocks a submit, while
the highest possible positive value is required to enable submit. There
must be at least one positive value, or else submit will never be
enabled. To permit blocking submits, ensure a negative value is defined.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>AnyWithBlock</code></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lowest possible negative value, if present, blocks a submit, Any
other value enables a submit. To permit blocking submits, ensure
that a negative value is defined.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>MaxNoBlock</code></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The highest possible positive value is required to enable submit, but
the lowest possible negative value will not block the change.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>NoBlock</code>/<code>NoOp</code></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The label is purely informational and values are not considered when
determining whether a change is submittable.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>PatchSetLock</code></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>PatchSetLock</code> function provides a locking mechanism for patch
sets.  This function&#8217;s values are not considered when determining
whether a change is submittable. When set, no new patchsets can be
created and rebase and abandon are blocked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This function is designed to allow overlapping locks, so several lock
accounts could lock the same change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allowed range of values are 0 (Patch Set Unlocked) to 1 (Patch Set
Locked).</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="label_allowPostSubmit"><code>label.Label-Name.allowPostSubmit</code></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If true, the label may be voted on for changes that have already been
submitted. If false, the label will not appear in the UI and will not
be accepted when reviewing a closed change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In either case, voting on a label after submission is only permitted if
the new vote is at least as high as the old vote by that user. This
avoids creating the false impression that a post-submit vote can change
the past and affect submission somehow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Defaults to true.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="label_copyMinScore"><code>label.Label-Name.copyMinScore</code></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If true, the lowest possible negative value for the label is copied
forward when a new patch set is uploaded. Defaults to false, except
for All-Projects which has it true by default.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="label_copyMaxScore"><code>label.Label-Name.copyMaxScore</code></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If true, the highest possible positive value for the label is copied
forward when a new patch set is uploaded. This can be used to enable
sticky approvals, reducing turn-around for trivial cleanups prior to
submitting a change. Defaults to false.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="label_copyAllScoresOnMergeCommitFirstParentUpdate"><code>label.Label-Name.copyAllScoresOnMergeCommitFirstParentUpdate</code></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This policy is useful if you don&#8217;t want to trigger CI or human
verification again if your target branch moved on but the feature
branch being merged into the target branch did not change. It only
applies if the patch set is a merge commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If true, all scores for the label are copied forward when a new
patch set is uploaded that is a new merge commit which only
differs from the previous patch set in its first parent, or has
identical parents. The first parent would be the parent of the merge
commit that is part of the change&#8217;s target branch, whereas the other
parent(s) refer to the feature branch(es) to be merged.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Defaults to false.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="label_copyAllScoresOnTrivialRebase"><code>label.Label-Name.copyAllScoresOnTrivialRebase</code></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If true, all scores for the label are copied forward when a new patch
set is uploaded that is a trivial rebase. A new patch set is considered
as trivial rebase if the commit message is the same as in the previous
patch set and if it has the same code delta as the previous patch set.
This is the case if the change was rebased onto a different parent, or
if the parent did not change at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can be used to enable sticky approvals, reducing turn-around for
trivial rebases prior to submitting a change.
For the pre-installed Code-Review label this is enabled by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Defaults to false.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="label_copyAllScoresIfNoCodeChange"><code>label.Label-Name.copyAllScoresIfNoCodeChange</code></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If true, all scores for the label are copied forward when a new patch
set is uploaded that has the same parent tree as the previous patch
set and the same code delta as the previous patch set. This means only
the commit message is different. This can be used to enable sticky
approvals on labels that only depend on the code, reducing turn-around
if only the commit message is changed prior to submitting a change.
For the Verified label that is installed by the <a href="pgm-init.html">init</a>
site program this is enabled by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Defaults to false.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="label_copyAllScoresIfNoChange"><code>label.Label-Name.copyAllScoresIfNoChange</code></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If true, all scores for the label are copied forward when a new patch
set is uploaded that has the same parent tree, code delta, and commit
message as the previous patch set. This means that only the patch
set SHA1 is different. This can be used to enable sticky
approvals, reducing turn-around for this special case.
It is recommended to leave this enabled for both Verified and
Code-Review labels.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Defaults to true.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="label_canOverride"><code>label.Label-Name.canOverride</code></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If false, the label cannot be overridden by child projects. Any
configuration for this label in child projects will be ignored. Defaults
to true.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="label_branch"><code>label.Label-Name.branch</code></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default a given project&#8217;s label applicable scope is all changes
on all branches of this project and its child projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Label&#8217;s applicable scope can be branch specific via configuration.
E.g. create a label <code>Video-Qualify</code> on parent project and configure
the <code>branch</code> as:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>  [label "Video-Qualify"]
      branch = refs/heads/video-1.0/*
      branch = refs/heads/video-1.1/Kino</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then <strong>only</strong> changes in above branch scope of parent project and child
projects will be affected by <code>Video-Qualify</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
The <code>branch</code> is independent from the branch scope defined in <code>access</code>
parts in <code>project.config</code> file. That means from the UI a user can always
assign permissions for that label on a branch, but this permission is then
ignored if the label doesn&#8217;t apply for that branch.
