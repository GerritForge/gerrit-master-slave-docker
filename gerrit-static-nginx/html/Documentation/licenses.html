                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS
PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  TO THE EXTENT THIS
LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1.  Definitions

  a.  "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work
      and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
      derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
      literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
      includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which
      the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any
      form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work
      that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an
      Adaptation for the purpose of this License.  For the avoidance
      of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
      phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation
      with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
      Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

  b.  "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
      such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances,
      phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other
      than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the
      selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
      intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
      entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
      contributions, each constituting separate and independent works
      in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective
      whole.  A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
      considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of
      this License.

  c.  "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original
      and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through
      sale or other transfer of ownership.

  d.  "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
      that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.

  e.  "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
      work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who

2.  Fair Dealing Rights.  Nothing in this License is intended to
    reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
    arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in
    connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or
    other applicable laws.

3.  License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
    non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
    copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
    below:

  a.  to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
      Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
      Collections;

  b.  to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
      Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
      reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
      identify that changes were made to the original Work.  For
      example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
      translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
      indicate "The original work has been modified.";

  c.  to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
      incorporated in Collections; and,

  d.  to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

  e.  For the avoidance of doubt:

    i.   Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes.  In those
	     jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
	     through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
	     cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
	     right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
	     of the rights granted under this License;

    ii.  Waivable Compulsory License Schemes.  In those jurisdictions
	     in which the right to collect royalties through any
	     statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived,
	     the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
	     royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
	     under this License; and,

    iii. Voluntary License Schemes.  The Licensor waives the right to
	     collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event
	     that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society
	     that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
	     society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted
	     under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised.  The above rights include the right to
make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the
rights in other media and formats.  Subject to Section 8(f), all
rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4.  Restrictions.  The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
    made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

  a.  You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
      terms of this License.  You must include a copy of, or the
      Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
      copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.  You may
      not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
      terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the
      Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
      terms of the License.  You may not sublicense the Work.  You
      must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to
      the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform.  When You Distribute or Publicly
      Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
      measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of
      the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
      recipient under the terms of the License.  This Section 4(a)
      applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
      does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
      made subject to the terms of this License.  If You create a
      Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
      required by Section 4(b), as requested.  If You create an
      Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
      required by Section 4(b), as requested.

  b.  If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
      Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been
      made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices
      for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You
      are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
      pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
      Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
      a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
      ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of
      service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
      parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
      extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
      specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does
      not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
      the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case
      of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
      the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
      Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by
      Original Author").  The credit required by this Section 4 (b)
      may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
      that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum
      such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
      authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of
      these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
      credits for the other contributing authors.  For the avoidance
      of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section
      for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
      by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
      implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
      sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor
      and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use
      of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
      permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
      Parties.

  c.  Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may
      be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
      Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as
      part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
      mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to
      the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
      honor or reputation.  Licensor agrees that in those
      jurisdictions (e.g.  Japan), in which any exercise of the right
      granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make
      Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
      modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the
      Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
      or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest
      extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
      to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this
      License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5.  Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6.  Limitation on Liability.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
    LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
    OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
    WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.

7.  Termination

  a.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
      License.  Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations
      or Collections from You under this License, however, will not
      have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
      entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
      Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of
      this License.

  b.  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright
      in the Work).  Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
      right to release the Work under different license terms or to
      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or
      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

  a.  Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
      Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
      the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted
      to You under this License.

  b.  Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
      Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
      on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
      under this License.

  c.  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
      to make such provision valid and enforceable.

  d.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver
      or consent.

  e.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
      parties with respect to the Work licensed here.  There are no
      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
      the Work not specified here.  Licensor shall not be bound by any
      additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
      You.  This License may not be modified without the mutual
      written agreement of the Licensor and You.

  f.  The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
      this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
      Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
      amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
      WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and
      Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention
      (as revised on July 24, 1971).  These rights and subject matter
      take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License
      terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
      provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in
      the applicable national law.  If the standard suite of rights
      granted under applicable copyright law includes additional
      rights not granted under this License, such additional rights
      are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
      intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
      law.</pre>

          trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
          modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original

          Original Code (or portions thereof).

          (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
          effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
          Original Code under the terms of this License.

          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
          granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)

          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
          that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
     Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.

               (c)    Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
          this License.

     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
     terms You offer.

     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
     understand it.

5. Application of this License.

     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
     will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
     Covered Code created under this License.

     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
     this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
     shall survive.

     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
     the 60 day notice period specified above.

     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
     Participant.

     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
     license.

     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
     prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
     rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
     License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
claims:

2.1.a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent
       or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use,
       reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute
       the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without
       Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

       Code (or portions thereof).

2.1.c. the licenses granted in this Section 2.1 (a) and (b) are
       effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
       Original Code under the terms of this License.

2.1.d. Notwithstanding Section 2.1 (b) above, no patent license is
       granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code;
       2) separate from the Original Code; or 3) for infringements
       caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii)
       the combination of the Original Code with other software

       Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger
       Work; and

2.2.b. under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling
       of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or
       in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
       of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
       have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications
       made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the

       or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the
       absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations

3.1. Application of License

The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute
are governed by the terms of this License, including without
limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may
be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future
version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must
include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source
Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of
this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You
may include an additional document offering the additional rights
described in Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code

Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must
be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this
License either on the same media as an Executable version or via
an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom
you made an Executable version available; and if made available
via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for
at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version
of that particular Modification has been made available to such
recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code
version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

3.3. Description of Modifications

You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain
a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered
Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,
from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including
the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b)
in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in
which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

3.4.a. Third Party Claims: If Contributor has knowledge that
       a license under a third party's intellectual property
       rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such
       Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must
       include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
       "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the
       claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom
       to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
       Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
       Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
       copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take
       other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
       newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received
       the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

3.4.b. Contributor APIs: If Contributor's Modifications include
       an application programming interface and Contributor has
       knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary
       to implement that API, Contributor must also include this
       information in the legal file.

3.4.c. Representations: Contributor represents that, except as
       disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor
       believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's
       original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights
       to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.5. Required Notices

You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of
the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)
where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You
created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a
Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also
duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code
where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating
to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on
Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions

You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met
for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that
the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the
terms of this License, including a description of how and where
You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice
must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute
the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under
a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms
of this License and that the license for the Executable version
does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the
Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If
You distribute the Executable version under a different license You
must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.7. Larger Works

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other
code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure
the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of
this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
must be included in the legal file described in Section 3.4 and
must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except
to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to
be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

6.1. New Versions

The H2 Group may publish revised and/or new versions of the License
from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
version number.

6.2. Effect of New Versions

Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of
that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the
terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the H2
Group. No one other than the H2 Group has the right to modify the
terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

6.3. Derivative Works

If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you
may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered
Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so
that the phrases "H2 Group", "H2" or any confusingly similar phrase
do not appear in your license (except to note that your license
differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that
Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
H2 License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original
Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not
of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered code is provided under this license on an "as is" basis,
without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,
including, without limitation, warranties that the covered code
is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance
of the covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove
defective in any respect, you (not the initial developer or any
other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
repair or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes
an essential part of this license. No use of any covered code is
authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer.

8. Termination

8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and
     fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware
     of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which
     are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
     License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in
     effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
     claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against
     Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
     Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
     "Participant") alleging that:

8.2.a. such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
       infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by
       such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
       License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
       prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of
       notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant
       a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
       future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii)
       withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor
       Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice,
       a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually
       agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
       is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You
       under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at
       the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

8.2.b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such
       Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
       infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by
       such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are
       revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
       sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
       Participant.

8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly
     or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved
     (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
     patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of
     the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1
     or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount
     or value of any payment or license.

8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and
     resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any
     distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
     termination.

9. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the
initial developer, any other contributor, or any distributor of
covered code, or any supplier of any of such parties, be liable to
any person for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party
shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This
limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.

10. United States Government End Users

The Covered Code is a "commercial item", as that term is defined in
48 C.F.R. 2.101 (October 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
software" and "commercial computer software documentation", as such
terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (September 1995). Consistent
with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code
with only those rights set forth herein.

11. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed
by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable
law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law
provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is
a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in
United States of America, any litigation relating to this License
shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara
County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs,
including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of
a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply
to this License.

12. Responsibility for Claims

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree
to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended
or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. Multiple-Licensed Code

Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
"Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
Your choice of this or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

Exhibit A

Multiple-Licensed under the H2 License, Version 1.0,
and under the Eclipse Public License, Version 1.0
(http://h2database.com/html/license.html).

<pre>Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
   documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program
by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:
(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction
with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are
not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with
this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
   license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
   publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
   Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
   object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
   license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
   import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
   if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
   shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
   if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
   addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
   by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
   other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
   se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
   licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
   provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe
   the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other
   entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
   for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement
   of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
   exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
   hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
   property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
   license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program,
   it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
   distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
   the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code
  form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
   and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
   conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
   conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
    for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
    consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
     party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
    Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
    manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial
use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by
the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection
with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims
or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such
claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and
cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a
commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a
Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes
performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those
performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related
to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with
its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not
limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment,
and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND
ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT
OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY
RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed
to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with
other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s),
then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if
it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions
of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable
period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all
Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees
to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably
practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions
(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No
one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify
this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement
Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to
serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each
new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it
was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is
published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including
its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated
in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under
this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this
Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each
party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</pre>

 #

 #
 #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or

5. Time Zone Database

  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
Database section 7.

 # 7.  Database Ownership
 #
 #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
 #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
 #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
 #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
 #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
 #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
 #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
 #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
 #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
 #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
 #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
 #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
 #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.</pre>

<pre>                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.</pre>

<pre>Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
   documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program
by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:
(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction
with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are
not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with
this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
   license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
   publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
   Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
   object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
   license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
   import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
   if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
   shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
   if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
   addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
   by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
   other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
   se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
   licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
   provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe
   the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other
   entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
   for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement
   of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
   exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
   hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
   property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
   license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program,
   it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
   distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
   the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code
  form under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
   and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
   conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
   conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
    for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
    consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
     party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
    Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
    manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial
use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by
the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection
with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims
or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such
claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and
cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a
commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a
Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes
performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those
performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related
to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with
its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not
limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment,
and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND
ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT
OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY
RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed
to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with
other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s),
then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if
it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions
of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable
period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all
Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees
to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably
practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions
(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No
one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify
this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement
Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to
serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each
new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it
was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is
published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including
its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated
in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under
this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this
Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each
party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</pre>

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE").  THE WORK IS
PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW.  ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.  TO THE EXTENT THIS
LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1.  Definitions

  a.  "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work
      and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
      derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
      literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
      includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which
      the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any
      form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work
      that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an
      Adaptation for the purpose of this License.  For the avoidance
      of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
      phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation
      with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
      Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

  b.  "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
      such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances,
      phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other
      than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the
      selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
      intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
      entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
      contributions, each constituting separate and independent works
      in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective
      whole.  A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
      considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of
      this License.

  c.  "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original
      and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through
      sale or other transfer of ownership.

  d.  "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
      that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.

  e.  "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
      work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who
      created the Work or if no individual or entity can be
      identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a
      performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other
      persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
      otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of
      folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the
      person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
      performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of
      broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.

  f.  "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
      terms of this License including without limitation any
      production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain,
      whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including
      digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a
      lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
      dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or
      entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or
      without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated
      works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work
      of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
      lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
      expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of
      applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or
      three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
      architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a
      phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected
      as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or
      circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a
      literary or artistic work.

  g.  "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
      License who has not previously violated the terms of this
      License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
      permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this
      License despite a previous violation.

  h.  "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the
      Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations,
      by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or
      public digital performances; to make available to the public
      Works in such a way that members of the public may access these
      Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them;
      to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and
      the communication to the public of the performances of the Work,
      including by public digital performance; to broadcast and
      rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or
      images.

  i.  "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means
      including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and
      the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work,
      including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in
      digital form or other electronic medium.

2.  Fair Dealing Rights.  Nothing in this License is intended to
    reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
    arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in
    connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or
    other applicable laws.

3.  License Grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
    non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
    copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
    below:

  a.  to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
      Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
      Collections;

  b.  to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
      Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
      reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
      identify that changes were made to the original Work.  For
      example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
      translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
      indicate "The original work has been modified.";

  c.  to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
      incorporated in Collections; and,

  d.  to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

  e.  For the avoidance of doubt:

    i.   Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes.  In those
	     jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
	     through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
	     cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
	     right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
	     of the rights granted under this License;

    ii.  Waivable Compulsory License Schemes.  In those jurisdictions
	     in which the right to collect royalties through any
	     statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived,
	     the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
	     royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
	     under this License; and,

    iii. Voluntary License Schemes.  The Licensor waives the right to
	     collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event
	     that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society
	     that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
	     society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted
	     under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised.  The above rights include the right to
make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the
rights in other media and formats.  Subject to Section 8(f), all
rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4.  Restrictions.  The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
    made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

  a.  You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
      terms of this License.  You must include a copy of, or the
      Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
      copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.  You may
      not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
      terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the
      Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
      terms of the License.  You may not sublicense the Work.  You
      must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to
      the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform.  When You Distribute or Publicly
      Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
      measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of
      the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
      recipient under the terms of the License.  This Section 4(a)
      applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
      does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
      made subject to the terms of this License.  If You create a
      Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
      required by Section 4(b), as requested.  If You create an
      Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
      required by Section 4(b), as requested.

  b.  If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
      Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been
      made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices
      for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You
      are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
      pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
      Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
      a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
      ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of
      service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
      parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
      extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
      specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does
      not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
      the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case
      of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
      the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
      Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by
      Original Author").  The credit required by this Section 4 (b)
      may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
      that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum
      such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
      authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of
      these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
      credits for the other contributing authors.  For the avoidance
      of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section
      for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
      by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
      implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
      sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor
      and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use
      of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
      permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
      Parties.

  c.  Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may
      be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
      Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as
      part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
      mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to
      the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
      honor or reputation.  Licensor agrees that in those
      jurisdictions (e.g.  Japan), in which any exercise of the right
      granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make
      Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
      modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the
      Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
      or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest
      extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
      to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this
      License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5.  Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6.  Limitation on Liability.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
    LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
    OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
    WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.

7.  Termination

  a.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
      License.  Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations
      or Collections from You under this License, however, will not
      have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
      entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
      Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of
      this License.

  b.  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright
      in the Work).  Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
      right to release the Work under different license terms or to
      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or
      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

  a.  Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
      Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
      the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted
      to You under this License.

  b.  Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
      Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
      on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
      under this License.

  c.  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
      to make such provision valid and enforceable.

  d.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver
      or consent.

  e.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
      parties with respect to the Work licensed here.  There are no
      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
      the Work not specified here.  Licensor shall not be bound by any
      additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
      You.  This License may not be modified without the mutual
      written agreement of the Licensor and You.

  f.  The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
      this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
      Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
      amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
      WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and
      Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention
      (as revised on July 24, 1971).  These rights and subject matter
      take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License
      terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
      provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in
      the applicable national law.  If the standard suite of rights
      granted under applicable copyright law includes additional
      rights not granted under this License, such additional rights
      are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
      intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
      law.</pre>
